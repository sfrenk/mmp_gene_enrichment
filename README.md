Rapidly determines enrichment of genes in a subset of Million Mutation Project (MMP) strains using Fisher's Exact Test with FDR correction. For more info on the MMP, follow this link: http://genome.sfu.ca/mmp/.

The app can be run here: https://sfrenk.shinyapps.io/mmp_app/

Note: Fisher's Exact Test is simple and rapid but not very powerful. Rare varient analysis tools such as SKAT offer a slower and more complex but also more powerful approach (see https://github.com/ttimbers/Million-Mutation-Project-dye-filling-SKAT for an excellent implimentation of SKAT for analysis of MMP strains).
